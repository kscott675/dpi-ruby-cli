- Preface: Hey guys, this is a game I created to simulate a fortune teller reading. Fun fact about me is that I used to read tarot cards for a living. Let me know if the reading resonates!

- This is an app that tells your fortune. Have an open mind and you might get the answer to a very important question.
- To get the most out of this, I would recommend thinking of a question or situation. If you can't think of anything in particular, keep your mind open and you can still get advice.
- When you're ready, here is what you'll do:

      -In the terminal, type "ruby app.rb"
      -Pick a number between 1 and 6 when prompted. You will have 3 tries until the game ends.
      -If you want to cancel, pick 0.
      -Get your message! You will have a chance to pull another card as many times as you wish. 

Have fun! :)
